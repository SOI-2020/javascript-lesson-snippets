# About

This project contains the Javascript and HTML snippets to demonstrate concepts
explained during the lessons of "Sistemi Orientati ad Internet" at the University
of Parma in 2020-2021.

First lessons focus on the Javascript language and the relative snippets can be
found under the `js` folder.

The other lessons are about how Javascript is used in HTML pages and the snippets
are under the `html` folder.
